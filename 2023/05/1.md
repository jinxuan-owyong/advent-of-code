[(56, 4), (60, 37)]

refers to the first and last mappings of the ABMaps
`mapFloor = ABMap[0][0]`
`mapCeil = ABMap[-1][0] + ABMap[-1][2]`
rB is destination, A is source
`AFloor = A`
`ACeil = (A + ASize - 1)`
`BFloor = B`
`BCeil = (B + BSize - 1)`
1. Starting from currQ = [(56, 4)] 
**2. Location    -> [(93, 4)] since `ACeil >= BCeil`; it is also guaranteed by `bisect_left` that `AFloor <= BFloor`; add [(93, 4)] into nextQ
3. Humidity    -> [(93, 4)] since `mapCeil < B`, resulting in bisect_left `idx > len(ABMap) - 1` (out-of-range) - not mapped => That means we also need to check if `AFloor < mapFloor`
4. Temperature -> [(57, 4)] since #2
5. Light       -> [(64, 4)] since #2
6. Water       -> [(64, 4)] since #3
7. Fertilizer  -> [(64, 4)] since #3
8. Soil        -> [(62, 4)] since #2
